Q2 — Top Customer Locations

Top cities by customer count were computed directly from the customer master file (customers_clean.csv). Nairobi is present in the dataset with 65 customers and is included in the overall city distribution.

Recommendation: focus marketing and logistics efforts on the top cities shown in the chart. Verify regional coverage if expected hubs (e.g., Nairobi) do not appear in top positions — data coverage or filtering may have been applied during earlier preprocessing.
