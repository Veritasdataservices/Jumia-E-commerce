Q7 — Payment Success Rate (N = 5000)

- M-Pesa: 2534 payments — Success 84.93%, Failed 10.02%, Pending 5.05%
- Card:   2466 payments — Success 84.55%, Failed 9.94%, Pending 5.52

Interpretation: Compare success/fail rates between methods to identify revenue risk. Higher failed % suggests payment friction for that method.
Recommendations:
1. Instrument and monitor failed payments by method and platform (App/Web).
2. Prioritize fixes for the method with the highest failed % (retries, UX, 3rd-party integrations).
3. Consider offering alternate checkout options or fallbacks when a payment attempt fails.
