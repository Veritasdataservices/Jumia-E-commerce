### 3. Key Insights for Q12: Customer Lifetime Value ðŸ’¡

Based on the LTV analysis, here are the key insights for improving customer engagement and profitability:

* **Average Customer Value:** The average customer generates approximately KES **173,448.59** in total revenue. This provides a clear benchmark for evaluating customer acquisition costs.
* **Skewed Distribution:** The distribution of LTV is highly skewed, with a long tail of high-value customers. This indicates that a small percentage of customers are responsible for a large portion of the business's total revenue.
* **Strategic Focus:** This insight is crucial for business strategy. It suggests that while mass-marketing is important, focusing on and nurturing the small segment of high-value customers could yield a much higher return on investment.

**Conclusion:** Understanding LTV allows the business to move beyond just counting new customers and instead focus on acquiring and retaining the most profitable ones. The analysis confirms that a small group of high-value customers are the most important segment to target for retention and loyalty initiatives.
