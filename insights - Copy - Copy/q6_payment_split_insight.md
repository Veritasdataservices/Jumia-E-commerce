# Q6 — Payment Method Split (Completed Payments — N = 2,982)

- **M-Pesa:** 1,506 payments (50.5%)
- **Card:** 1,476 payments (49.5%)

**Interpretation:** M-Pesa is the preferred checkout option, reflecting strong mobile money adoption among customers. The near parity with Card payments indicates that card acceptance is also meaningful — likely for higher-value orders or customers preferring card convenience.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Operational:** Prioritize monitoring and SLAs for M-Pesa integrations (uptime, reconciliation, refunds).
2. **Growth:** Test targeted incentives to influence payment mix (e.g., small discounts for card use or M-Pesa cashbacks).
3. **Next analysis:** Compute average order value (AOV) by payment method and by platform (App vs Web) to understand whether payment channels map to different basket sizes or customer segments.
