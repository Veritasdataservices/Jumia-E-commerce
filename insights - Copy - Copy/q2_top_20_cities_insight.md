Expanding the view to the **top 20 cities** reveals **Nairobi ranking at #17**, showing 65 customers — lower than regional hubs such as Eldoret, Nyeri, and Machakos.

**Insight:** 
Regional towns are leading in customer signups, signaling strong adoption of e-commerce beyond traditional metro centers. 
This could reflect improved logistics coverage, localized marketing, or increased digital literacy outside major cities.

**Recommendation:** 
Sustain regional growth efforts while identifying barriers (such as delivery costs or competition) that may be limiting urban participation. 
Future segmentation by revenue or order frequency will help confirm whether regional customers are also driving higher sales volume.
