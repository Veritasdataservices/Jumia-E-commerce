# Veritas Data Services: Jumia E-commerce Data Analysis Portfolio

## Executive Summary and Project Goals

This portfolio project presents a **comprehensive data analysis** of a synthetic e-commerce dataset, designed to model the transaction and customer behavior patterns of a major retailer like Jumia. The analysis, conducted by **Veritas Data Services**, focuses on transforming raw data across 14 key business questions into **actionable intelligence**.

### Methodology Note

The dataset utilized for this analysis is **synthetic** and was programmatically generated. A core feature of the analysis is demonstrating how to derive insights (Q10) even when faced with common real-world **data limitations**, such as the absence of a direct **`order_items` table**.

## Key Operational KPIs & Health Check

| Metric | Finding | Health Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Delivery Success Rate (Q5)** | High percentage of orders successfully delivered. | **Stable** |
| **Payment Success Rate (Q7, Q14)**| High overall success rate, but failures cluster in specific platform/method combinations. | **Good (Needs Optimization)** |
| **Order Status Concern (Q5)** | Cancellations remain the highest category of non-delivered orders. | **Warning** |

## Final Summary & Strategic Recommendations

#### 1. Customer Value & Retention Strategy
**Insight:** LTV and RFM analysis confirms that a **small segment of Champions drives the majority of revenue**, making customer retention the most crucial priority.

**Recommendation:**
* **Segmented Retention:** Implement a dedicated loyalty program for **'Champions'** to secure their high spend. Focus re-engagement campaigns on **'At-Risk'** customers.

#### 2. Operational & Platform Optimization
**Insight:** The business is well-supported by a balanced platform mix. However, the cross-analysis (Q14) shows payment friction is not random; it clusters in specific channels, and **Cancellations** are the top non-delivered order status.

**Recommendation:**
* **Targeted Tech Audit:** Immediately investigate the specific platform-payment combinations (e.g., **Card on Web**) that exhibit the highest failure rates.
* **Fulfillment Efficiency:** Review the workflow for all **Cancelled** orders (Q5) to pinpoint the exact time-of-cancellation to reduce operational costs.

#### 3. Product Portfolio & Inventory
**Insight:** The portfolio is dominated by specific high-value categories, but these categories are estimated to be return revenue hotspots (Q10).

### Q10. Analysis of Order Returns

**Overall Return Volume**Â Â 
Our analysis of the `jumia_orders` table shows a total of **480 orders** have a status of "Returned".

**Returns by Category (Blocked)**Â Â 
**Key Finding:** It is not possible to determine which product categories face the highest return rates.Â Â 
**Reason:** The data to link an `order_id` (from `jumia_orders`) to a `product_id` (from `jumia_products`) is not available.Â Â 
A connecting table, such as `order_items.csv`, is required to complete this analysis.


**Recommendation:**
* **Profit Protection:** Implement high-resolution QC processes for the top-returning categories, focusing on **standardized sizing charts for Fashion** and detailed tech specs for Electronics.
